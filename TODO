- the execute_app/run_app business might be done better, simpler. e.g.
  having to pass the block for every command becomes a bit tedious.

- move test suite from bacon -> test/unit.

- map more commands/applications.

- test how this works in async mode - I imagine that it might mess with
  @command_queue

- the applications-part of command socket should be rethought. it's
  weird as it is now.

- add logger.

- check command/application input and raise ArgumentError.

- maybe let commands handle the response, so something useful could be returned?

- possibly catch all exceptions, so everything doesn't die? or should this be
  be the users responsibilty?

- filter events
