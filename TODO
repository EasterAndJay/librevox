- the execute_app/run_app business might be done better, simpler. e.g.
  having to pass the block for every command becomes a bit tedious.

- move test suite from bacon -> test/unit.

- map more commands/applications.

- test how this works in async mode - I imagine that it might mess with
  @command_queue

- how can applications be used w/ command socket? would be nice if you could
  do e.g.  originate("user/coltrane", :endpoint => bridge("user/davis"))  and
  it would translate to  "originate user/coltrane &bridge(user/davis)"

- add logger.

- check command/application input and raise ArgumentError.

- maybe let commands handle the response, so something useful could be returned?

- possibly catch all exceptions, so everything doesn't die? or should this be
  be the users responsibilty?

- filter events
